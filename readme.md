## Works best with...
In my current setup I'm using some themes and plugins to make the whole experience more enjoyable without adding weight to the startup.

- reattach-to-user-namespace install with brew install reattach-to-user-namespace this is to make copy and paste great again on mac

- [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

- [Bullet train zsh theme](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train-oh-my-zsh-theme) with [maglev tmux theme](https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev)

- [Vundle for Vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
