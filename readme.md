## Works best with...
In my current setup I'm using some themes and plugins to make the whole experience more enjoyable without adding weight to the startup.

- iTerm configuration files for extra swag

- Introducing Neovim support and swag

- Uses vim-plug for plugin management on neovim

- Also remember to enable true colors on your terminal and italics support to use with the OceanicNext theme and Operator Mono font. If you use the install script then all is made for you. [Read More](https://bruinsslot.jp/post/how-to-enable-true-color-for-neovim-tmux-and-gnome-terminal/)

- reattach-to-user-namespace install with brew install reattach-to-user-namespace this is to make copy and paste great again on mac

- [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)

- [Node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

- [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

## Installing Everything from Scratch

- First log into your AppStore and download X-Code we will need this for git and other maybe important tools.
- Now git clone the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mike3run/dotfiles.git
```

- Now cd into `scripts`

```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
# If you want my AppStore downloads
# They only work if you had downloaded them too before
$ ./install.sh --mas-install
```

- Sit back and enjoy
- Note: `mas.sh` script will only work if you have also purchased those apps so you might want to edit that part or delete it totally
- I'm talking about all the commands that start with `mas install XXXXX`

- Now cd outside of the dotfiles folder and run

```sh
$ rcup -d dotfiles -v
```

- That will sync the actual dotfiles in your system and you can git pull for life and be in sync.

- Enjoy

- Remember to pull from time to time and in neovim run `:PlugUpdate`
