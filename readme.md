## Works best with...
In my current setup I'm using some themes and plugins to make the whole experience more enjoyable without adding weight to the startup.

- iTerm configuration files for extra swag

- Introducing Neovim support and swag

- Uses vim-plug for plugin management on neovim

- Also remember to enable true colors on your terminal and italics support to use with the OceanicNext theme and Operator Mono font. [Read More](https://bruinsslot.jp/post/how-to-enable-true-color-for-neovim-tmux-and-gnome-terminal/)

- reattach-to-user-namespace install with brew install reattach-to-user-namespace this is to make copy and paste great again on mac

- [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)

- [Node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

- [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

- Google Play Music Desktop Player - With a custom widget made by me :D
## To-Do
